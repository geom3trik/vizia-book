# Resources

A typical GUI application may need to deal with a number of resources, such as:

- Fonts
- Icons
- Images
- Stylesheets
- Translations

These resources are loaded into vizia via the `Context` and are then managed by the `ResourceManager`. This chapter covers how to load these different resources.

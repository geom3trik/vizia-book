# Getting Started

## Installing Rust
The Vizia framework is built using the Rust programming language. Currently, to use Vizia, you will need to install the Rust compiler by following the instructions over at [https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

## Running the Examples
The [Vizia repository](https://github.com/vizia/vizia) on github contains a number of example applications. To run these examples, first clone the repository to a local directory, then with your terminal of choice, navigate to this directory and run the following command:

```
cargo run --example name_of_example
```

Where `name_of_example` should be replaced with the example name.

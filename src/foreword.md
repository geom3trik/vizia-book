# Foreword

Welcome to the Vizia book!

Vizia is a crate for building desktop GUI applications. It presently supports Windows, Linux, and MacOS desktop targets.

The Vizia project's home is [https://github.com/vizia](https://github.com/vizia) and the main Vizia repository is [https://github.com/vizia/vizia](https://github.com/vizia/vizia).


This book aims to act as a guide and reference for Vizia, and hopes to teach you how to use Vizia, whether you've done any GUI programming in the past or not.

# Localization

Localization, often shortened to l10n, refers to the adaption of an application to meet the language, cultural, and other requirements of a specific target locale.

Localization refers to both translation of text, as well as other customizations such as[^note]:

- Numeric, date and time formats
- Plural categories
- Currency
- Keyboard usage
- Bidirectional text
- Symbols, icons and Colors
- Text or graphics which may be subject to misinterpretation
- Varying legal requirements
- and many other things.

Vizia uses [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) to provide a way to localize text strings with expressive translations.
